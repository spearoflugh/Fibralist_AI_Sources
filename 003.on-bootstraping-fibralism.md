In the [Fibralist
Manifesto](https://thefibralist.substack.com/p/the-fibralist-manifesto),
I outlined the core principles of a new way of conceptualizing
civilization. The goal is to propose a framework tailored to the digital
age. Unlike print culture, where information is bound to physical media
like paper, digital information can be produced, recorded, and broadcast
instantaneously at near-zero marginal cost. This shift implies that the
primary societal challenge becomes the management of rapid change.
Consequently, the first principle of Fibralism is temporal
stability---cultural continuity over time---rather than spatial
organization (as suggested by the words \'city\', and politics derived
from the Greek *polis*). My preliminary exploration of this concept
provides the necessary context for this essay.

In this essay, I explore the practical dimensions of the Fibralist
proposition. The central question is: how can a Fibralist culture be
bootstrapped from the current state of affairs? I will focus here on
strategic thinking rather than immediate tactical considerations; the
latter will be addressed later and tailored to each specific \'fiber.\'
My approach remains relatively generic, though I will frequently draw
examples from my own fiber to flesh out these theoretical observations.

##From one ripple to the next

The starting point of Fibralism is the observation that current
institutions are adapted to a written culture, but not a digital one.
The 'why' is addressed in the Manifesto; here, I take it as a given. The
logical conclusion is that existing institutions will eventually
collapse under the weight of their own inefficiencies. Digital
technologies will act as an acid upon these structures. This must be
reckoned with: it means that, by default, things are going to break
down. There is no need for active revolutionary action. Unlike other
ideologies, Fibralism does not aspire to rise from the ashes of a *Grand
Soir* as Communism or Nazism did.

However, this does not mean we should simply wait. The collapse of the
written order will be chaotic, and many competing ideologies will vie
for control. The advantage of Fibralism is that it does not originate
from a purely theoretical standpoint. It does not aim to engineer an
'ideal man' who exists only in a philosopher's dream.

Consider the Enlightenment. It was sparked by a reinterpretation of
classical Greek and Roman traditions---a 'weaponization' of *Logos* and
skepticism (as opposed to revealed truth), civic virtues (as opposed to
the divine right of kings), and codified law (as opposed to customary
law). Similarly, Fibralism seeks inspiration from the past rather than
from utopia.

The question, then, is not how to destroy, but how to build. This is no
simple task: on one hand, the 'powers that be' will not view their
rivals with a benevolent eye; on the other, competing ideologies---for
there will be alternative propositions---will not simply surrender
because they are (from my perspective) wrong. Thus, the challenge is to
build under adversarial conditions. But first things first: what exactly
are we trying to build?

##The egg before the chicken

The question of where to begin is not a "chicken or the egg" dilemma;
the sequence is clear. Culture and education must come first. The
cornerstone of Fibralism is the extension of civilization across time,
and the foundation of any culture is a shared language.

In my case, as a Westerner, this would be achieved through a return to
classical studies---specifically, the revival of Latin as a cultural
marker. Just as the Jewish people unearthed Hebrew to create the
official language of Israel, we can reclaim Latin for Western
Civilization. This proposal rests on several key pillars:

-   **Distributed Growth**: This can be done in a decentralized manner.
    Communities can gather and bootstrap this process independently,
    regardless of their location.

-   **Historical Depth vs. Utopian Invention**: Latin is not a synthetic
    language like Esperanto. While it remains the official language of
    the Vatican---a small demographic---its influence is vast. As the
    ancestor of Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese, it provides
    the linguistic bedrock for over a billion people, sharing a massive
    portion of their vocabulary and grammatical structure.

-   **The AI Paradigm Shift**: Large Language Models (LLMs) will
    revolutionize education. While technical knowledge will become
    increasingly accessible through AI---diminishing the marginal value
    of a teacher spending time on technicalities---this is not the case
    for Latin and classical literature. Latin must become a living
    language again, used by humans for humans. In this respect, it
    differs fundamentally from a programming language, which is a tool
    for machine interaction and can be learned via machines without a
    loss of essence.

-   **Building Community**: Language is the ultimate tool for cohesion.
    Consider the French Third Republic, where teachers were famously
    called the *"Hussards noirs de la république"* (the Black Hussars of
    the Republic). They were seen as evangelists for a secular, common
    way of life. Fibralism envisions a similar commitment to its
    foundational values.

-   **Ancestral Continuity**: Technical skills can be acquired later or
    elsewhere---at home, via a computer. Fibralism, however, requires
    that every "fibrizen" be an active participant in their
    civilizational fiber. Studying the classics is not optional; it is a
    prerequisite for belonging.

-   **The "Aristocracy of Everyone"**: If this sounds elitist, it is
    because it is. The goal is for the plumber, the electrician, and the
    builder to have read Seneca in the original text. There is no
    contradiction here: practical labor and intellectual life are both
    essential dimensions of existence. Education should introduce every
    fibrizen to both, recognizing that its true value can only be
    appreciated through experience.

In essence, the Fibralist proposition is post-liberal and even
post-Enlightenment. It does not aim for radical openness or absolute
inclusivity. Instead, it recognizes a societal hierarchy in which the
living are not the only ones with a voice. There is a necessary tension
between individual liberty and the duties inherent in a "Fibrization."
Some aspects of communal life cannot be decided by a single generation
alone.

To ensure this, one could imagine generation-based assemblies: for
example, Generation G proposes a law, which is debated by Generation
G+1, and finally voted upon by Generation G+2. This would ensure that no
individual can profit from tinkering with the legal process, as they
would likely be dead by the time their proposal is enacted. This is,
admittedly, a radical departure from current norms, producing a society
less "flexible" than our liberal democracies, but far more stable across
time.

##Semi open Society

While the primary step toward a Fibralist civilization---a process we
shall call **fibrization**---is the preservation of the cultural fiber,
it is not the only one. Education acts as a gravitational anchor, used
to build communities that share a unified worldview. The ultimate
objective is to appropriate and, eventually, to govern space. Governing
here aligns with the traditional definition---the monopoly on legitimate
violence---but its application is transformed. In this model, the rule
of law is not tied primarily to spatial or geographic boundaries.
Instead, what matters most is whether or not an individual is a
**fibrizen**.

Unlike liberal societies, a Fiber maintains explicit tiers of political
rights. This structure is better suited to a digital culture where
physical mobility is commonplace, yet cultural identity remains fixed.

From a "bootstrapping" perspective, the strategy is one of geographic
concentration. By physically occupying space, the movement prepares to
take effective control when outdated institutions inevitably fail. This
requires tireless work toward physical autonomy: food, water, power,
civil engineering, and an alternative communication grid independent of
outside entities. The goal is a homogeneous culture; therefore,
incentives must be designed to attract fibrizens while deterring
non-Fibrizens from settling in the area.

This shift will be both gradual---as state functions are increasingly
outsourced---and abrupt, as the monopoly on violence cannot be sustained
indefinitely. Consider current official smartphone apps that require the
approval of third parties like Google or Apple; this is a precursor to
the outsourcing of authority. When traditional police or military forces
cease to function---whether due to lack of funding or a collapse of
legitimacy---the fibrizens must be ready to fill the vacuum.

## The Limits of Openness

A critical question remains: how much openness can a Fibrization afford?
This is a delicate, perpetual equilibrium. It is technically impossible
to resolve this issue through pure theory; however, several principles
must be maintained:

-   **The Three-Generation Integration**: A Fibrization is not a closed
    system, but entry must be costly and slow. Dual nationality is
    unthinkable. Integration requires a multi-generational commitment:
    one cannot be fully part of the fiber unless they were raised by
    those who were themselves fully raised within it. Thus, it takes
    three generations to produce a full fibrizen. If the grandparents
    initiate the project, only the grandchildren reach full status.

-   **Political Hierarchy and the "Guest" Status**: Fibrizens and
    non-Fibrizens may share the same physical space, but they occupy
    different positions on the political spectrum. They are subject to
    different laws, taxes, obligations, and protections. This does not
    imply boundless domination or slavery; rather, non-Fibrizens are
    viewed as guests. One treats guests with the dignity due to any
    human being, but they are not part of the political bargain. They
    have no say in their level of taxation or the laws governing them.
    They either accept the terms or they are not welcome.

-   **The Judicial Heart: Inclusion and Exclusion**: Crimes against the
    Fiber are the most significant threats to the project and must be
    punished with the utmost severity. The loss of "Fibrizenship" is a
    devastating sentence because it impacts several generations. While
    technicalities regarding the status of descendants must be refined,
    the core principle remains: the heart of the judicial system governs
    the "openness" of the society. Beyond Fibrizenship loss, the primary
    sentences are expressions of exclusion: **exile** (physical
    exclusion) and the **death penalty** (permanent exclusion from life
    itself).

##Fibralist virtues

Articulating the Fibralist virtues will be the primary tool for
inspiring participation. We must follow the example of the Romans, who
reinterpreted and expanded upon the four Greek civic virtues---Wisdom,
Justice, Courage, and Temperance---initially defined by Plato and
Aristotle. These were later refined again through Saint Augustine's
seven cardinal virtues.

A Western Fiber faces the significant task of reinterpreting these
classical virtues for a modern setting. The digital revolution
introduces novel moral dilemmas precisely because modern technologies
routinely enable actions that were previously unthinkable. Defining how
these virtues apply to the digital age is not merely a theoretical
exercise; it is a central practical necessity for the survival and
cohesion of the Fiber.

##To be continued

These ideas do not yet constitute a roadmap. At best, they are beginning
to serve as a compass, offering a sense of the directions we must
pursue. Fibralism remains a work in progress.
