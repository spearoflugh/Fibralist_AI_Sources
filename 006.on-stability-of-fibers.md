#On the Stability of Fibers

Fibralism’s central innovation is prioritizing temporal continuity over spatial
control. Yet this raises an immediate objection: if culture must remain stable
across generations, does this not require oppressive rigidity? How can a living
culture evolve while maintaining identity?  Stability and immobility

Stability is not synonymous with immobility. Consider Western civilization:
clearly different in 2026 than in 1054, yet equally clearly identifiable as a
continuous tradition. The Ship of Theseus paradox applies—but this doesn’t
invalidate the concept. A person at 60 differs from that person at 20, yet we
recognize them as the same individual. Cultural identity works similarly: change
occurs within a recognizable pattern of continuity.

If we consider “the West” –as this is my own culture I am going to use it as a
particular example but the exercise could be done with other cultures like
Sinic, Hindu, Islamic– there is a clear pattern. One can trace historical trends
going back to ancient Greece (philosophy and critical inquiry) Rome (Rule of
law, republican governance, engineering and city planning) and Judeo-Christian
tradition (ethical framework on truth, intrinsic value of individuals as images
of God, linear time concept). Scholars have spent considerable effort tracing
these influences, and the details matter but the core exists and is easily
identifiable. It can be experimented at the individual level: if you travel to
another country of the same Fiber you don’t feel that displaced but for the
language that maybe you don’t speak. I am not lost in a street or in a social
encounter in Germany, the USA, Australia, Canada. The cultural codes are very
close and if there are minor differences over which people will spend their day
talking about , the famous narcissism of small differences, it has nothing to do
with the experience that I would feel in a street of Tehran and would feel even
more foreign in rural Asia or the Arabian desert.

The point being: a Fiber is not like an object that you can hold in your hand
and that doesn’t change as time goes by. It doesn’t mean that it is not a valid
concept that can be identified pretty precisely. One practical way to measure it
is by its depth. A culture is what is the most deeply ingrained into
individuals. For instance the way individuals are treated across different
cultures appears at every level. It appears in cultural production (like books,
stories, acts, movies etc.) but also in the legal system (is the individual the
primary notion or is he seen as part of a collective etc.) and most often finds
its source in deep theological considerations. Let’s take an actual example. In
Christianity every human is seen as an image of God –Imago Dei– after the
“Fall,” this image is considered damaged by Original Sin, and the individual
requires a Savior (Jesus) to restore that relationship. In Islam man is seen as
a successor of God. The idea is that nothing is like God. Man is born in purity
and his role to be the representative of God on earth but man has forgotten his
duty. You see a subtle difference in the general scheme. In both cases
individuals start in an unsatisfactory state from a religious perspective. The
solutions are different: Christians rely on a personal relation with Christ. The
community is achieved through the body of Christ aiming at a mystical and
spiritual unity. On the other hand Muslims stress the necessity to follow
religious law that requires a context in which there is unity of the social,
legal and spiritual –the Ummah–. The point is not to make an extensive
comparative analysis of both cultures but to remark that both cultures have
sensible differences at every scale of the society. Just like wearing a dress
and make up doesn’t turn a man into a woman, wearing a dress or adopting surface
level cultural habits won’t turn a person raised in Christianity in a Muslim and
vice-versa.

It also doesn’t mean that mobility across cultures is impossible. Of course it
is, but they are not quick nor easy things. The whole story of humanity is about
invasions, cultural and ethnic cleansing etc. Of course a place can be
Christianized or integrated to the Islamic spheres. It takes generations to do
so. Which is the framework of Fibralism.

Now let’s get back to the question: how can the concept of a Fiber be understood
under those circumstances ? It is a fair question because, as we just saw, there
are internal and external forces that are going to act on the Fiber. In other
words: how can the tradition be maintained without turning into a strangulating
set of constraints? This question is especially important to tackle in a digital
culture where things change at the speed of a finger swapping between
applications. 

##The Keel

An appropriate allegory is to see the culture as the keel of a ship. It is a
stabilizing element in a place where turmoils happen. In a digital culture
information moves at the speed of light and there are no geographic constraints
anymore. Thus every trend on social media can be seen as waves hitting the
Fiber. Those waves might be powerful but they don’t last. News cycles rarely go
over a few days. The Fiber is supposed to be here without a visible ending.
Fibra sine fine. From a concrete point of view: the Keel is what allows the ship
to recover stability. Likewise the study of classical texts, the continual
reinterpretation of classical virtues, is going to act as a stabilizer. The idea
being that the cultural framework is solid enough to absorb the disturbance of a
digital life.

The fact that it relies on classical texts is in itself a guarantee. Those ideas
have already survived many generations and haven’t been disproved by reality.
The time filter is the most efficient one on the cultural level. Compare with
ephemeral trends that no one remembers a few months after they reached their
peak virality moment.

The use of Latin in a Western Fiber would be the primary tool. Language is the
first marker of a culture. The fact that it is not a synthetic language goes in
the same direction as the cultural trend: it is a tried and tested thing. This
is the language of a state, the Vatican, and is linked to a billion speakers
through romance languages that are a direct evolution of it. Moreover it gives
access to a lot of classical literature that can be read in the original. You
can imagine that English remains the lingua franca on the world stage while
having inside the Fiber the use of Latin. It creates a two tier system which is
totally in line with the overall Fibralist approach. The goal of a Fiber is not
to be universal.

In order to keep the culture at the same time alive and stable the importance of
education couldn’t be more pronounced. From a Fibralism point of view there is a
large part of education that is mandatory. Also cultural implication of Fibrizen
isn’t supposed to be limited at youth. Cultural mass events are also a
mechanism. Think Olympic Games but not restrained to sports. Also participating
in local cultural events must be seen as taxes are seen in modern democracies.
This is the bare minimum to be considered a full Fibrizen. This is a place where
there is a tension between individual liberty and social duties. From a
Fibralist point of view the commitment to the Fiber is a lifelong endeavor. It
is even larger than a lifespan as the aim is to extend across generations.
Technopraxis

The question remains: who decides what is part of the Fiber tradition? Answering
this requires a new concept: Technopraxis—the deliberate practice of designing
and operating cultural institutions that respond to emergent phenomena without
claiming scientific objectivity. Technopraxis is neither pure science (which
seeks objective truth) nor pure politics (which aggregates current preferences).
It is practical wisdom applied to institutional design, operating in the space
where technical knowledge meets moral judgment regarding cultural continuity.

It is difficult to define exactly who decides what belongs to the Fiber,
precisely because the Fiber is, by nature, a catallactic object. Just as the
grammatical structures and vocabulary of a language are not defined by any
single individual, a Fiber has no clear-cut borders. Yet, specific institutions
can formalize these emergent patterns. In France, the Académie Française
fulfills three vital roles:
   - The Dictionary (Le Dictionnaire): Its main function is to edit and publish
     the official dictionary of the French language. It acts as the
     “Legislative” body (the Clerks in the Tier system) for words.
   - Language Defense: It guards against “linguistic pollution,” such as the
     encroachment of English loanwords (e.g., attempting to replace “email” with
     “courriel“).
   - The Seat of Tradition: It awards literary prizes and serves as the ultimate
     authority on grammar and style.

One can imagine similar institutions designed to stabilize culture within a
digital environment. The Académie is an aristocratic institution by definition
(comprising very few members). However, a Fiber should possess several such
institutions so that every Fibrizen can participate in at least one. Just as
Enlightenment universalism led to concrete innovations like universal military
service—which fundamentally changed European warfare—Fibralism’s philosophical
shift will require new institutional forms. The Académie Française provides one
model; the Fiber will need many.

Universal military service was a direct consequence of the Enlightenment
program: since citizens were seen as equal (in opposition to the Ancien Régime),
it followed that all should take part in the defense of the nation—La nation en
armes (as expressed in the French National Anthem’s call: ‘Aux armes,
citoyens!’). This acted as a “cheat code”; Napoleon used it to dominate Europe
because his troops were more numerous and more motivated than the ragtag
collections of his opponents. This demonstrates that profound philosophical
shifts have direct consequences on society. Fibralism should be viewed as a deep
“update” to the Enlightenment project—one at least as significant as the
Enlightenment was to Medieval Europe. Just as the Enlightenment required new
forms like mass conscription, Fibralism requires new forms for cultural
maintenance. While there will be implications for defense, the focus here
remains on culture.

Developing these institutions is what I call Technopraxis. It is a synthesis of
technical social engineering and actual practice. To distinguish it from
science, politics, or sociology, consider medicine: Is doping “healthy”? It
maximizes performance today but destroys health tomorrow. Are antibiotics good?
They cure today’s patient but breed resistance for tomorrow’s. Medicine cannot
be a pure science because “health” inherently involves moral judgments about
trade-offs across time. Cultural evolution faces identical challenges: what
strengthens the Fiber today might weaken it across generations.

Technopraxis, like medicine, requires practical wisdom operating within
constraints that science cannot resolve. The way we judge cultural evolution
cannot be dictated by a “holy book” that is unable to evolve. Such a static
model was fit for a written culture but is no longer viable in a digital one.
This means Technopraxis will function more like a Protocol than a fixed Program.
While it is difficult to describe in its entirety before it manifests, we can
identify certain constraints:
   1. Dunbar Hierarchy Levels (DHL): Technopraxis should be applied at many
      levels of the Fiber. There must be identifiable mechanisms to enable different
      levels of interaction, creating a dynamic process for defining the Fiber.
   2. Structural Events: Technopraxis should lead to events that structure life,
      such as periods specifically dedicated to cultural development (similar to the
      Olympiads and the universal truces of Ancient Greece).
   3. Mandatory Participation: Just as there is no “choice” regarding
      conscription in a modern democracy, a Fibrizen cannot skip their cultural duties
      and remain a full member of the community. Since Fibralism is inherently
      non-universal, this is manageable: one could lose “Fibrizen” status without
      being physically evicted, but they would lose their voice in the evolution of
      the Fiber.
