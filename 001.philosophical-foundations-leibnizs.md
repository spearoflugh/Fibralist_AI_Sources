# Philosophical Foundations - Leibniz's Nightmare

The theme of the Antichrist is making a significant comeback on the
intellectual stage. Recently, Peter Thiel and Sam Wolfe published an
article titled "[Voyages to the End of the
World](https://firstthings.com/voyages-to-the-end-of-the-world/)," which
coincides with a series of (formerly private) [lectures by Thiel on the
subject](https://luma.com/antichrist). Additionally, Auron MacIntyre
[hosted a podcast featuring Nick Land and Aleksandr
Dugin](https://podcasts.apple.com/cl/podcast/nick-land-vs-aleksandr-dugin-debate-guests-nick-land/id1657770114?i=1000730457103)
to discuss the topic.

The resurgence of this ancient conversation is deeply linked to modern
information technology. First, there are the philosophical implications
of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)---though, for scientific
reasons, I doubt it will ever reach such levels. Is AGI a new God? Or is
it a false, techno-materialistic deity, which would define it as an
Antichrist?

Furthermore, society is becoming increasingly self-aware through social
media. The word "Apocalypse" stems from the Book of Revelation; much
like Eve eating the fruit of knowledge, the fact that society is
revealing itself to itself through a collective "internal monologue" on
social media carries profound metaphysical implications.

## Anté/Anti

There is a subtle distinction here that is worth emphasizing. In French,
there are two terms that are phonetically and orthographically close but
carry different meanings: ***Antéchrist*** and ***Antichrist***. This
nuance may not be immediately clear in English, where "Antichrist" is
typically the only term used.

The *Antéchrist* (with the prefix *ante-*) refers to the one who arrives
**before** Christ---much like John the Baptist. Conversely, the
*Antichrist* (with the prefix *anti-*) is the **opposite** or opponent
of Christ. However, since Christ is expected to return for the Parousia,
a new *Antéchrist* must emerge to herald this second coming. From the
perspective of the Book of Revelation, the *Antéchrist* and the
*Antichrist* may ultimately be the same figure, as the rise of the
Antichrist serves as the definitive sign of the End Times.

This superposition of ideas is highly relevant to our discussion. Is the
digital transformation of the world a form of Revelation? Is AI the
*Anti* or the *Anté* Christ? Given the practical limitations of AI, at a
first glance, the "Anté" prefix seems more appropriate. Indeed, even
cutting-edge AI remains relatively "stupid," a point I have previously
explored in:


Therefore, the mantle of the **Antichrist** appears far too large for
such a limited technology. In and of itself, AI lacks the inherent power
to serve as the decisive force of the Apocalypse. However, the mere fact
that AI forces us to confront the question of the End Times qualifies it
as an ***Antéchrist***.

Social media has been instrumental in facilitating this dialogue. There
is a parallel here to the idea that one cannot truly fake courage:
because the act of faking courage *is* courage, the imitation becomes
the reality. Similarly, if people believe---rightly or wrongly---that
AGI is the coming Antichrist, that belief alone steers the cultural
conversation toward these eschatological themes and fundamentally
reshapes society. In this sense, AI (or at least the fear of AGI) will
have earned its title as the *Antéchrist*. This is exactly the
phenomenon Nick Land would describe as **hyperstition**.


## The end of the reign of causality

The crux of the entire discussion is the "End of Times." But which
times, exactly, are we referring to? At the very least, we are
discussing the collapse of the overarching arc of Western
civilization---if not the end of humanity itself in a truly Apocalyptic
vision---specifically the era known as the Enlightenment.

Leibniz's dream---the idea that human disputes could be resolved through
formal logic and calculation---was a cornerstone of the Enlightenment
project. While the movement was multifaceted, it essentially rested on
three core pillars:

1.  The Supremacy of Reason.

2.  The existence of a methodical approach to acquiring knowledge.

3.  The inevitability of Progress**.**

This project reached its mathematical zenith in the [Hilbert
Program](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/),
specifically through his inquiries on the foundation of mathematics. To
make a long story short: the inquiry yielded negative results. Gödel and
Turing demonstrated that the project was fundamentally doomed. [Gödel's
Incompleteness
Theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems)
proved that there are truths that, within any sufficiently powerful
formal system, cannot be proved by the system itself. Meanwhile,
[Turing's Halting
Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) showed that no
methodical or "automatic" approach could ever solve all questions.
Ironically, to prove these limitations, Turing invented the very engine
of our modern world: the computer. Truly, the world is a small place.

In this sense, viewing the computer as the *Anté and Antichrist* does
not sound so far-fetched; in fact, it is largely technically correct.
The computer heralds the end of the Enlightenment and puts and end to
the whole project.

The irony is lost on no one when you consider what a computer actually
does: it computes. It is the literal manifestation of Leibniz's dream.
What we have here is not the inverse of a hyperstition, but rather the
ultimate example of a hyperstition pushed to its absolute limit. The
dream is killed by its own realization.

We gained the computer in this process, but the price we paid was the
loss of causality. Why? Because we now know there are things that are
provably non-computable. This implies that events can occur for which no
explanation can ever be found.

Here, "explanation" follows Leibniz's characterization: an explanation
is a description of a phenomenon that is shorter than the phenomenon
itself. If the description is not shorter, it is simply the phenomenon
itself. In scientific terms, an explanation consists of a theory
combined with initial conditions; computation within that theory is
meant to recreate or represent the phenomenon.

Causality was the fundamental belief---the very God of the
Enlightenment---that everything had a cause and could be explained.
Computability theory killed causality in the same way that humanity
killed God.

While we gained the computer in this process, the price was the loss of
causality itself. Why? Because there are phenomena that are provably
non-computable. This implies that certain things occur for which no
explanation can ever be found.

Slowly but surely, society is becoming aware of this second "killer": if
science killed God, then science proceeded to kill itself with the
computer. This represents the profane union of the *anté* and the
*anti*.

A trivial---yet pervasive---manifestation of this is the battle over
"misinformation." It raises a haunting question: why are we no closer to
the truth now that digital technology has granted humanity free and
instantaneous speech?

We have lost the sovereignty of Reason, yet things continue to happen in
the real world regardless, devoid of any hope for an underlying "why."
With the framework of reason dismantled, what is left?

## Anticausality

The physicist views life through a rearview mirror. For this profession,
the present is merely a function of the past. Causality, articulated
through elegant theoretical frameworks, explains the world as it
currently is. But what does it have to say about the future?

The physicist might reply: "That part is easy. Any point in the future
can be treated as a 'present' for which our current moment becomes the
past. Using my theories, I can predict what will happen." However, a
simple glance out the window at the sky suggests it isn't quite that
simple. Accurate weather forecasting always seems to be "ten years
away."

More fundamentally, while a physicist can predict exactly where a stone
will land when thrown into the air, they are powerless if I throw a
bird. Physics struggles to say anything meaningful---or even
interesting---about life.

Causality for living entities is fundamentally different from the
causality of billiard balls. It operates in reverse: if I decide to
build a house, it is the future house that causes my behavior
today---prompting me to lay brick after brick. In short, the explanation
for the present lies in the future.

Nick Land might call this hyperstition. Perhaps; but this phenomenon is
well-known and typically called will. Will is the transformation of the
objective world initiated from the virtual world---the realm of thoughts
and aspirations. It is a form of anti-causality.

What is truly novel, however, is that digital
technologies---specifically social media---allow humans to coordinate
individual wills in an unprecedented manner. We have returned to the
territory of the will, but it is no longer merely the individual will of
a figure like Alexander the Great conquering Asia Minor. It is something
collective.

What happens next remains a mystery. The idea of Progress was killed by
the computer, so where do we go from here? What are the principles of
this new era? The Bible offers no more explanation for what follows than
a Netflix series or a fairy tale: "And humanity lived happily, and had a
lot of kids, ever after\..." Really?
